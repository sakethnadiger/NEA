Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal in which all neighbours of a node are discovered before discovering a further neighbour of one of these neighbours. It creates the impression of a 'water spill' from the start node (you can see this for yourself in the animation section), as all nodes equidistant from the start node are firstly discovered before moving to the next node a further unit away. BFS is guaranteed to return the shortest path on an UNWEIGHTED graph - on a weighted one it merely returns the shortest path based on number of nodes, and not weight. As opposed to a stack used in DFS, BFS uses a queue - a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
