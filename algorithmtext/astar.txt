A* algorithm is essentially a variation of Dijkstra’s algorithm. It allows for faster traversal and efficiency by using a heuristic function to make smarter decisions as to which node to explore next. At every stage, the distance from the current node to the end node is estimated (we could a method as simple as Pythagoras‘ theorem or something as complex as the Haversine function, which can calculate the distance between two points on a globe given their latitude and longitude). This estimate is added to the known distance to create a tentative distance, and as in Dijkstra’s algorithm, the node with the smallest tentative distance is chosen from a priority queue.
