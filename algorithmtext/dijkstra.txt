Dijkstra’s algorithm is a breakthrough in the fields of Computer Science and Graph Theory. It allows us to determine the shortest distance from a source node to any other node on a weighted graph. Published by Edgar Dijkstra in 1959, it is now a cornerstone for modern pathfinding algorithms. It can be used in network routing, finding routes on a map, and several more applications in which the shortest cost is necessary. Dijkstra’s algorithm is implemented computationally using a priority queue which is sorted in ascending order by known distance from  the start node.
