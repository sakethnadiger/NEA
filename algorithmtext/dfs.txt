Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal in which one branch is explored fully before backtracking to the most recent node which has undiscovered branches. It does this by using a stack - a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure which enables backtracking. Imagine walking along a path until you reach a dead-end; you would then walk back along the same path until you reach another path which you have not already walked along and repeat this process. DFS does NOT return the shortest path once a target node is reached. A cool application of DFS is a backtracking maze generator  - you can try this out in the animation section.
